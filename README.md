# CNN-for-handwritten-digits-
CNN to recognize handwritten digits by using the MNIST dataset to train the NN.
The model can recognize only photo with black background and white foreground. It is trained to recognize ONLY handwritten digits. Is good if you write in the correct way the number, if you create an digit image with different inclination is difficult thta the NN can recognize it.

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
data: photo to test the model
Results: graphical results of the model
src: 2 different types of file. main.py: file to create the model. model_testing.py: file to preprocessing the test image and predict the result.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
i used python 3.9.2 to run this project. Before starting to try the model you have to create it, in order to do that run the file "main.py"
